* Installation
** Manually
   1. Clone the repo.
   2. Add the repo path to your emacs ~load-path~.
   3. Load it when needed.

** From MELPA
   TODO: MELPA support.

** straight
   You can also install this package through the [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]] package manager.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (straight-use-package '(consult-bibtex :host github
                                            :repo "mohkale/consult-bibtex"))
   #+end_src

* Configuration
  This package should work out of the box. Simply run ~M-x consult-bibtex~ to
  interactively select bibtex entries.
  The file [[file:consult-bibtex-embark.el][consult-bibtex-embark.el]] provides several commands that can be used
  alongside ~consult-bibtex~. By default the command ~consult-bibtex-insert-citation~ is
  run when you select a bibtex entry but you can configure this with
  ~consult-bibtex-default-action~.

  This package exposes a map you can use alongside ~embark-act~ called ~consult-bibtex-embark-map~
  however embark isn't setup automatically. You can do so manually by simply adding
  this map to ~embark-keymap-alist~.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (with-eval-after-load 'embark
      (add-to-list 'embark-keymap-alist '(bibtex-completion . consult-bibtex-embark-map)))
  #+end_src
